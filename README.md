## Work Experience
#### Inventory & Business Process Specialist | Data Analyst @ Iconix WaterWorks LP (_2006-2023_)
- Identified data dependencies and discrepancies; Conducted comprehensive data quality assessments using **Trifacta** and **Excel Data Models** with a primary focus on standardizing and seamlessly integrating ERP systems.
  - understanding the data needs of the new ERP system, the current ERP system, and what data requires modification as we move from one to the other
  - created documentation as we continue to standardize the format and expectation of data that is manually entered, such as creating material descriptions
  - Idenfied fields that should be entered during various business processes, that the current ERP system does not deem mandatory, but the new ERP system does
- Tested and fine-tuned GenAI **Python** scripts designed for categorizing new items, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and making critical adjustments for optimization.

- Created interative dashboards using **Power BI** to visually present data-driven insights to operational staff, resulting in significant increase in their understanding of inventory issues, and leading to a **40% decrease** in outstanding paperwork processes.
  - focusing on low turning inventory, branches were able to identify the material and choose to either increase sales and have the items become higher turning inventory, or remove the inventory and no longer stock the material; allowing inventory to be more efficient
  - focusing on outstanding paperwork, branches were able to better understand why the paperwork was outstanding in the system (identify what was offside), and then make the appropriate corrections allowing inventory to be more accurate
  - focusing on the top items of the company, branches were able to better understand how their locations played a part in the overall company success; allowing for a more cohesive culture building opportunity
  - as most users were not familiar with dashboards, quick reference sheets were created for each to assist with how to read the information within, as well as filtering options and moving around within the dashboards. This proved to be extremely helpful.

- Developed business processes to streamline decisions made between multiple departments  
  - The company decided to change from Sales Matrix pricing to Replacement Cost pricing, this was a shift in thinking and required new decision matrixes to be developed, as well as identifying what background information was now required. Change Management was also a large factor that contributed to the success.


#### Configuration Builder @ Sanchez Computer Associates Inc. (_2000-2005_)
- Configured customized banking software; working with both development and testing teams.
  - pinpointing any issues that arose and shared with the development team
  - documented the changes between builds for the testing team to develop testing plans
- Avoided scheduling conflicts between multiple projects
  - many different software projects and customizations required the correct fixes and upgrades went into the correct versions of the
    customized software and to ensure that the customer received their software on time with the correct updates / upgrades
